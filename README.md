# RageSplit
LiveSplit Auto Split Script for Rage. Uses a game timer that omits loading time, menu time etc. The script also does automatic splits when entering new levels, automatically starts timer when entering game from main menu and negates the end-cutscene time from the run time at the final level change. Note that this only works with a specific route at the moment.
